## Usage

#### Textbook
In the textbook there is a words collection that contains 3600 frequently used English words. The words in the textbook are sorted by difficulty levels. The first 400 most frequently used words are not included, because it is believed that this is the basic stock of knowledges, which has left from the previous attempts of studying.

In the textbook there are groups of words divided into pages. There is a translation, a sentence example and an ability to listen to an audio recording for each word.

You can also add a word to the Difficult words section to create a collection of difficult words.

#### Dictionary
The dictionary consists of 2 sections: difficult words and learned words. Make a collection of words that are difficult for you, practise, and once you have learned the word you can add it to the learned words.

#### Mini-games
There are currently two mini-games in the app: sprint and audio challenge. In the sprint game you need to choose the right translation for the largest number of words in a specified period of time. At the end of the game the results will be shown. The audio challenge game allows you to train your listening skills. Listen to the words and choose the correct translation for them. At the end of the game the results will be shown.

#### Statistics
The statistics page contains daily results of your games: sprint and audio challenge, as well as the total daily statistics.
