## Usage

#### Textbook
In the textbook you are presented with a collection that contains 3600 frequently used English words. The words in the collection are sorted by difficulty levels. The first 400 most frequently used words were not included in the collection. It is believed that this is the basic stock of an adult, left over from previous attempts to learn the language.

In the textbook, you have collections of words that are divided into pages, for each word there is a translation, an example sentence and the ability to listen to an audio recording.

You can also add a word to the dictionary in the compound words section to create a collection of compound words.

#### Dictionary
The dictionary consists of 2 sections: compound words and learned words. Gather a collection of words that are difficult for you, practice, and once you have learned the word, you can move it to the learned words
